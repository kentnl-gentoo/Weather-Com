Yes, there are bugs! And some belong to the weather.com servers and
cannot be fixed with this API (or should not...).


BUG 1:
======
Tue Apr 14 23:50 2005
Abstract: Cannot use strings containing a '/' for searches 
          (like 'New York/Central Park').
Problem Description:
--------------------
The weather.com server does not work with any search string containing
a '/' - wether it is URL encoded or not!
Problem.

Problem Solution:
-----------------
There's no real solution as long as nobody fixes the server software,
but there's a workaround.
The new locations cache as extended with V0.4 does store each location
found by any search. Therefore, if one searches for 'New York', for
example, the cache will store the location IDs for the search string
itself but also for all locations found:

  $locations_cache => {
  	'new york' => {
  		'USNY1000' => 'New York/La Guardia Arpt, NY',
  		'USNY0998' => 'New York/Central Park, NY',
  		'USNY0999' => 'New York/JFK Intl Arpt, NY',
  		'USNY0996' => 'New York, NY'
  	},
  	'new york/central park, ny' => {
  		'USNY0998' => 'New York/Central Park, NY'
  	},
  	'new york/la guardia arpt, ny' => {
  		'USNY1000' => 'New York/La Guardia Arpt, NY'
  	},
  	'new york, ny' => {
  		'USNY0996' => 'New York, NY'
  	},
  	'new york/jfk intl arpt, ny' => {
  		'USNY0999' => 'New York/JFK Intl Arpt, NY'
  	},
  }

By this way, if one now searches for 'New York/Central Park, NY'
he'll get the proper response. The search mechanism has been reworked
in a way that also a search for 'york/central' would return a valid match.
