=head1 NAME

weather.pl - Sample script to show the usage of the I<Weather::Com::Simple>
module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #> ./weather.pl [-d]
  
  Welcome to Uncle Tom's weather station...
  
  Please enter a location name to look for, e.g
  'Heidelberg' or 'Seattle, WA', or 'Munich, Germany'
  
  Type 'end' to exit.
  
  $>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

**IMPORTANT** You first have to register at I<weather.com> to get a
partner id and a license key for free. Please visit their web site
L<http://www.weather.com/services/xmloap.html>. Then edit this script
and fill in the data into the corresponding variables at the top of 
the script.

The sample script I<weather.pl> asks you for a location name - either 
a city or a 'city, region' or 'city, country' combination. It then uses 
the I<Weather::Com::Simple> module to get the current weather conditions 
for this location(s).

If no location matching your input is found, a "no locations found" 
message is printed out.

Else, the number of locations found is printed followed by nicely
formatted weather data for each location.

The command line parameter '-d' enables debugging mode (which is
enabling debugging within all used packages (Weather::Com::Simple,
Weather::Com::Cached, Weather::Com::Base).
