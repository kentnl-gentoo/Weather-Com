=head1 NAME

Weather::Com::Units - class representing units of measure

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #!/usr/bin/perl -w
  use Weather::Com::Finder;

  # you have to fill in your ids from weather.com here
  my $PartnerId  = 'somepartnerid';
  my $LicenseKey = 'mylicense';

  my %weatherargs = (
	'partner_id' => $PartnerId,
	'license'    => $LicenseKey,
  );

  my $weather_finder = Weather::Com::Finder->new(%weatherargs);
  
  my @locations = $weather_finder->find('Heidelberg');

  print "Speed is messured in ", $locations[0]->units()->speed();
  print " for this location.\n";  

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Via I<Weather::Com::Units> one can access the units of measure that
correspond to the numeric values used in its parent location object.

This class will B<not> be updated automatically with each call to one
of its methods. You need to call the C<units()> method of the parent
object again to update your object.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

You usually would not construct an object of this class yourself. 
This is implicitely done when you call the C<units()> method of one
location object.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 distance()

Returns the unit of distance used.

=head2 precipitation()

Returns the unit of precipitation used.

=head2 pressure()

Returns the unit of barometric pressure used.

=head2 speed()

Returns the unit of speed used.

=head2 temperature()

Returns the unit of temperature used.
